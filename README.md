# mrdplot
mrdplot and clmcplot tools for variable logging (C++) and data manipulation/visualization (MATLAB)

## Description 

mrdplot/clmcplot is a logging tool first developed by Stefan Schaal along with the SL robot simulator back in 1999. Since then many researchers have modified the code dramatically with improvements, new features, etc... But unfortunately, due to the lack of a central repository, each different laboratory developed their own variations of the code.

The goal of this repository is to 1) try integrating some of these different variations into a single common place, 2) further develop existing functionality.

The current version of C++ wrapper compiles easily as a ROS Catkin project.
